# BareMetalNASM
A bare metal program designed for i386 CPU's.

- It runs directly on cpu, without any operating system. 
- It's loaded by BIOS via Master Boot Record...
- ...and performs some actions to load relevant resources from hard drive...
- ...and sets up Global Descriptor Table then switches to 32 bit mode...
- ...where it gives all it's power to what would be an OS kernel written in C.
